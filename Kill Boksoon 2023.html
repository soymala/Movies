                <h1>Synopsis</h1>
                    <p> Gil Bok-Soon (Jeon Do-yeon) is a contract killer working for M. K. Ent. Highly regarded by her peers, she has a 100% success rate and is one of a few
                         killers rated "A" by her company. She is also a single mother to Jae-yeong (Kim Si-a), a closeted teenager who studies at a prestigious private 
                         school. M. K. Ent. is run by Cha Min-Kyu (Sol Kyung-gu) - a powerful and experienced killer, who holds much respect for Bok-Soon; and by his 
                         younger sister, Cha Min-Hee (Esom), who despises her. Bok-Soon is sexually involved with a co-worker, Han Hee-Sung (Koo Kyo-hwan) - a skilled killer,
                          whose career progress was thwarted for unknown reasons. Shortly before Bok-Soon is set to renew her contract, she is assigned a sensitive job that she 
                          is unwilling to fulfill</p>
