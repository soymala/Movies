                <h1>Synopsis</h1>
                    <p> Set in 1999, the story revolves around Na Bo-ra (Kim Yoo-jung), a seventeen-year-old high school student with a bright personality. Bo-ra's best friend,
                         Yeon-du (Roh Yoon-seo), who has been preparing to visit the US for heart surgery, suddenly declares that she cannot leave as she has fallen in love with 
                         a boy from their school whose name she knows as Baek Hyun-jin (Park Jung-woo). Bo-ra promises that she will follow Baek Hyun-jin, find out everything about 
                         him, and email what she discovers. Reassured, Yeon-du departs. At school, Bo-ra starts to follow Hyun-jin. One day, she overhears that Hyun-jin and his 
                         best friend Poong Woon-ho (Byeon Woo-seok) will join the broadcasting club at school, so she successfully auditions to join the club. While Woon-ho joins 
                         the club, Hyun-jin does not. Bo-ra tries to get close to Woon-ho in order to observe Hyun-jin. Hyun-jin, mistaken that Bo-ra is interested in him, asks 
                         her to date him only to be rejected by her. Meanwhile, Bo-ra realizes that she has fallen in love with Woon-ho, who has developed feelings for her as well. 
                         When Yeon-du returns to Korea after successful heart surgery, they realize that Bo-ra has been following the wrong boy, and that the real 'Baek Hyun-jin'
                         whom Yeon-du loves is actually Poong Woon-ho, a confusion caused by the boy wearing his friend's school jacket bearing his name tag. Loyal to her friend, 
                         and protective because of her health condition, Bo-ra conceals that she loves the same Woon-ho. Then Bo-ra starts to avoid Woon-ho so that their blossoming
                         relationship will end, but through Hyun-jin, Yeon-du learns that Woon-ho and Bo-ra like each other. A tearful Yeon-du tells Bo-ra that she can give up
                         Woon-ho for the sake of their friendship. Meanwhile, Woon-ho prepares to move back to New Zealand to resume life with his mother and younger brother. On 
                         the day of his departure, with the help of Yeon-du and Hyun-jin, Bo-ra arrives at the train station just in time for them to confess their feelings before 
                         separating. They maintain contact while Woon-ho plans to attend university in Seoul. Without explanation, Woon-ho stops answering Bo-ra's emails; she never
                          hears from him again. Heartbroken, confused, and angry, Bo-ra tries to get over him. Time passes as Bo-ra attends university and matures. In 2019, she 
                          receives an invitation to an art exhibition from a person named Joseph, who turns out to be Woon-ho's younger brother, from whom she learns that Woon-ho 
                          died all those years ago. Joseph thanks Bo-ra for remembering Woon-ho and says that the happiest moments in Woon-ho's short life were spent in her company.
                           As the film ends, Bo-ra views a video made by Woon-ho that depicts their time together.</p>
