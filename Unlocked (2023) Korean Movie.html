                <h1>Synopsis</h1>
                <p>Lee Na-Mi (Chun Woo-Hee) works as a marketer at a start-up company. She is an ordinary office worker who works hard every day. She also works part-time
                     at her father’s cafe, Cafe Mizi. One day, Lee Na-Mi loses her smartphone on the bus and it is picked up by someone. When Na-mi uses a friend’s phone to 
                     call, Oh Jun-Yeong (Im Si-Wan) uses a fake voice app to speak so his voice won’t be recognized, instructing her to pick up her phone at a repair shop. She
                      does this so he can get access to her password and as he pretends to fix her broken phone screen, he installs spyware on her phone. Na-Mi unexpectedly walks 
                      around and does everything with her phone: every action, conversation and text is monitored by Jun-Yeong. Jun-Yeong slowly invades into Na-Mi’s personal life, 
                      causing her father to be suspicious of him. Na-Mi expresses curiosity about Jun-Yeong as they seem to have a lot in common. He claims to work at a software 
                      company and seemingly tries to help her with the spyware. Na-Mi is fired from her job after Jun-Yeong leaks confidential information and frames her. He also 
                      tries to make Na-Mi believe that it was her best friend who is behind the spyware. Ultimately Jun-Yeong succeeds in isolating Na-Mi from everyone important 
                      in her life. Meanwhile, Detective Woo Ji-Man (Kim Hee-Won) investigates a murder case involving a dead body that was found on a remote mountain. There, he 
                      finds clues that points to his son Woo Jun-Yeong as the possible perpetrator. Seven additional bodies are found which points to Jun-Yeong who keeps the 
                      smartphones of his victims, the latest one, Eun Mi-gyeong, who authority believed had run away. In a shocking twist at the end, Na-Mi and her father fight 
                      for their lives while Detective Woo Ji-Man uncovers the truth about Jun-Yeong.</p>
